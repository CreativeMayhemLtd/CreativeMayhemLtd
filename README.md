# Creative Mayhem Ltd.

**Creative Mayhem Ltd.** operates at the intersection of protocol, narrative, and infrastructure — building, breaking, and reimagining systems where control, data, and culture collide.  
We work in adversarial environments, under hostile timelines, and with unconventional tools.

## 🚀 Live Projects

### [Fingrr] *(Pending Release)*
**Fingrr** is a next-generation secure messaging and object-validation network that keeps communication untouchable, untraceable, and unprovable.  
It blends BitTorrent’s resilience, Tor’s anonymity, and Signal’s encryption to guarantee provable trust, privacy, and message authenticity in the most hostile conditions.  
Built for environments where compromise is expected and trust must be mathematically provable.

### [Memescreamer](https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/memescreamer)
**Memescreamer** is an autonomous media generation utility that transforms global news into emotionally resonant, AI-generated content — complete with voice, music, video, and story structure.  
It powers commentary, understands emotional context, and orchestrates entire broadcasts — fully automated, without human bottlenecks.

The **Memescreamer Study** is our ongoing live testbed for orchestrating narrative at scale, proving how automated systems can scan, interpret, and inject signals into the cultural bloodstream faster than any human editorial cycle.

**[Doomscroll.fm](https://doomscroll.fm)** is the proof-of-concept deployment — a relentless 24/7 broadcast that stitches together headlines, music, and satire into an unfiltered cultural indictment in real time.
