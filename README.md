### Human tools for a post-platform world

Creative Mayhem is a hybrid consultancy, studio, and lab building systems that keep people connected to meaning, value, and each other in an age dominated by automation.  

We create **human-scale infrastructure** for a world that’s scaling away from people — tools for those who still want to make, trade, play, and communicate.

## What We’re Currently Building

### [Memescreamer](https://memescreamer.com)
An experimental media engine that turns the daily noise of the internet into autonomous broadcast.  
Each episode is generated from real headlines and social flux, creating narrative, voice, and music through machine collaboration.  
Proof of concept at [**Doomscroll.fm**](https://doomscroll.fm)

## Our Philosophy

Humans will need independent, peer-to-peer systems to survive in B2AI economies.  
Creative Mayhem builds those systems — practical tools for communication, entertainment, exchange, and creative resilience.  

We design for clarity, autonomy, and endurance. Our work favors small, local, inspectable tools over opaque networks. What matters is keeping human circuits alive and generative, not nostalgic.

## Security and Integrity

Security is not a feature — it is a condition.  
A system remains secure only while it’s observable, understandable, and within human control.  
We build with privacy, minimal data, and independence in mind.  

**Our principles:**
- **Transparency:** Trust comes from visibility and comprehension.  
- **Autonomy:** Control belongs to the operator, not the vendor.  
- **Resilience:** Systems should serve human intent, even under stress or failure.
