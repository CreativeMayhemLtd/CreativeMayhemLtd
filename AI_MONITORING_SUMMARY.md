## 1. Monitoring Objective
Creative Mayhem maintains a systematic process to ensure Sortalizer remains accurate, safe, and transparent. Our goal is to monitor the performance of our "Unfiltered Reality" data aggregation to ensure users receive a representative and traceable view of the marketplace.

## 2. Systematic Data Collection
We actively collect and analyze data on the system's performance throughout its lifecycle, including:
* **Technical Robustness:** Automated monitoring of search retrieval success and API stability from upstream providers (Tavily, GPT-4).
* **Traceability Logs:** Maintaining machine-readable records of AI-generated outputs and their corresponding source URLs via `isBasedOn` metadata.
* **User Feedback:** Capturing and reviewing user-reported anomalies or inaccuracies in the EMRV (Estimated Market Resale Value) ranges.

## 3. Accuracy & Bias Mitigation
To prevent "drift" or systematic errors, we perform regular audits of our "unfiltered" ranges:
* **Representative Checks:** Ensuring raw data provides a broad view of current market listings.
* **Grounding Verification:** Verifying that AI-generated summaries accurately reflect the content of the linked source URLs.

## 4. Incident Management
In accordance with established best practices for trustworthy AI, Creative Mayhem maintains an internal procedure to investigate and, if necessary, report any serious incidents to the relevant national authorities within the mandatory 15-day window.
